# Solution 

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
print ("Packages Import;SUCCESSFUL")
```


```Python
# reading the sales data into the pandas dataframe

# Solution

bikes_df =  pd.read_csv("C:/Users/HP/Desktop/_EXCLUSIVE DATA SCIENCE BOOT CAMP_STUDENT FOLDER/_DATASET/bikes.csv")

#### Data Modification
```Python
# Adding the following 3 columns; TotalCostPrice, SalesRevenue, Profit.

# TotalCostPrice : To be obtained by (OrderQuantity x CostPrice_usd)
bikes_df["TotalCostPrice"] = bikes_df["OrderQuantity"] * bikes_df["CostPrice_usd"] 

# SalesRevenue : To be obtained by (OrderQuantity x SellingPrice_usd)
bikes_df["SalesRevenue"] = bikes_df["OrderQuantity"] * bikes_df["SellingPrice_usd"] 

# Profit : To be obtained by (SalesRevenue - TotalCostPrice)
bikes_df["Profit"] = bikes_df["SalesRevenue"] - bikes_df["TotalCostPrice"]
bikes_df.head()
```

## DATA ANALYSIS
## Data Filtering 
```Python
# Filtering out only the data relevant to solving the problem statement 

is_a_usa = bikes_df["CustomerCountry"] == "United States"
is_bike = bikes_df["ProductCategory"] == "Bikes"

bikes_df[(is_a_usa) & (is_bike)]

top_most_5 = bikes_df[(is_a_usa) & (is_bike)]
top_most_5
```

#### Data Aggregation
```Python
#Aggregating the total profit by United states for bikes sales 

#solution

top_most_5 = top_most_5.pivot_table(values = "Profit", index = "CustomerState", aggfunc = np.sum)
top_most_5
```

#### Data Sorting
```Python
# Sorting the aggregated data,
# in order to rank the top 5 most profitable states in USA 

# Solution 

top_most_5_states = top_most_5.sort_values("Profit", ascending = False)
top_most_5_states
```

#### Result
```Python
# The Top Most-Profitable 5 States for the Bike product category in the United States

# Solution

top_most_5_states.head()
